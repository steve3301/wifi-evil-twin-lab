# 📡 Wi-Fi Evil Twin & Deauthentication Lab

## 🧭 Overview
This project presents a **controlled laboratory simulation** of a Wi-Fi Evil Twin and deauthentication scenario,
conducted for **educational and defensive security research**.

The objective is to understand how **rogue access points** operate and how such threats can be **detected and mitigated**
in real-world wireless environments.

---

## 🎯 Scope
- Educational and ethical use only  
- Performed in an isolated lab environment  
- No real-world or unauthorized networks were targeted  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Hardware
- **ESP8266**
- **Arduino IDE**
- Test Access Point
- Monitoring Laptop

---

## 🔴 Offensive Simulation
- Simulated a **rogue access point (Evil Twin)**
- Triggered **deauthentication frames** to observe client behavior and connectivity impact

---

## 🔵 Defensive Analysis
- Detected rogue access points using **SSID and BSSID anomaly analysis**
- Observed abnormal **deauthentication patterns**
- Logged and analyzed wireless activity for suspicious behavior

---

## 📘 Key Learnings
- Understanding rogue access point behavior  
- Importance of continuous wireless monitoring  
- Practical exposure to **Wi-Fi attack vectors and defensive techniques**
