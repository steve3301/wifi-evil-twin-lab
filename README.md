# Wi-Fi Evil Twin & Deauthentication Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates a controlled laboratory simulation of a Wi-Fi Evil Twin and deauthentication attack
for educational and defensive security research purposes.

The objective is to understand how rogue access points operate and how such attacks can be detected
and mitigated in real-world networks.

## Scope
- Educational and ethical use only
- Performed in an isolated lab environment
- No real-world networks were targeted

## Tools & Hardware
- ESP8266
- Arduino IDE
- Test Access Point
- Monitoring Laptop

## Offensive Simulation
- Simulated a rogue access point (Evil Twin)
- Triggered deauthentication frames to observe client behavior

## Defensive Analysis
- Identified rogue APs using SSID and BSSID anomaly analysis
- Observed unusual deauthentication patterns
- Logged and analyzed wireless events

## Key Learnings
- Understanding rogue AP behavior
- Importance of wireless monitoring
- Practical exposure to Wi-Fi attack vectors and defenses

## Disclaimer
This project is strictly for educational purposes.
No unauthorized networks were attacked.
